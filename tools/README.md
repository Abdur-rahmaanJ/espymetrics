# EspyMetrics tools

Right now EspyMetrics doesn't have any tools, but normally this
directory would contain tools and automation that would not be
packaged with the production service. H

ere are some examples of useful ones:

* Download upstream dependency source code
* Build scripts
* Deploy scripts. Quick CLI interface for pushing to stage.


* CHANGELOG generator. Use git messages to create a default CHANGELOG
  section.
