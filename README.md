# EspyMetrics

EspyMetrics is an example application built to demonstrate several
aspects of basic enterprise software development, as taught by my
**[Enterprise Software with Python][esp]** video course, distributed by
O'Reilly.

This code is runnable and useful as is, but I recommend reviewing,
vetting, and adapting it to your standards.

All code and content within the EspyMetrics repo is offered without
warranty, and open-sourced under the 3-clause BSD license.

Documentation is quite sparse right now, though if you want a good
example of Sphinx/RST documents, you don't have to look much further
than [ReadTheDocs][rtd]. [Boltons docs][boltons_docs] are hosted
there, and I couldn't recommend them enough. See segment 4.11,
Documentation, for more information.
