# EspyMetrics

EspyMetrics is an example application built to demonstrate several aspects,
broad and fine, of the Enterprise Software with Python video course,
distributed by O'Reilly.

This code may be useful as is, but I recommend reviewing, vetting, and
adapting it to your standards. All code and content within the
EspyMetrics repo is offered without warranty, and licensed under the
3-clause BSD license.

## TODO

* Design document
* Implementation!
* Tests
