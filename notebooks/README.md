# Enterprise Software with Python Notebooks

Here are the notebooks created and used during Segment 5.4 of
[Enterprise Software with Python][esp], *Best Practices - Design
Patterns*.

The notebooks can be viewed here on GitHub, or through
[the nbviewer][nbviewer]. Here are the nbviewer links for your
convenience:

* [Stepwise processor](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mahmoud/espymetrics/blob/master/notebooks/stepwise_demo.ipynb)
* [Decorators](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mahmoud/espymetrics/blob/master/notebooks/decorators_demo.ipynb)

These are simple idioms that with a focus on composability and
maintainability. There are many other language features worth
exploring. See [Yasoob's open book *Intermediate Python*][impy] for a
great summary of the key ones.
